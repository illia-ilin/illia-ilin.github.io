I am starting my journey today. I am starting with [[ChatGPT's 30 Days of DevOps]]. I think, it's an interesting starting point.

Yesterday I analized the plan, subscribed to DevOps industry influencers recommended by ChatGPT, found all the books from the list of 10 most essential books for DevOps beginners, also recommended by ChatGPT. I put all these recommendations to [[ChatGPT's 30 Days of DevOps]].

I've also started to post this to [my website](https://ilin.tech).

So,
#### **Day 1: DevOps Introduction**
- Read "The Phoenix Project" by Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, and George Spafford
- Watch: [Introduction to DevOps and its culture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I94-tJlovg)

I've started to read "The Phoenix Project" and "The DevOps Handbook" simultaneously. The first book looks so wordy and irrelevant, but I hope I change my mind later.

The video is about obvious things for me, but I think, it's a good suggestion for the beginners. Just to grasp the main ideas.

And, by the way, after 6% of "The Phoenix Project" became more interesting. Also the book has a lot of unusual, eloquent English words, not related to the technical world. Usually in dialogues, and this way this book looks like fiction one, like literature.

Also, I don't know for sure, if this book is comfortable for complete newcomers, but I will post the review later.

Also, the day before I started the Diary of DevOps, I've started to take part in the [AWS Cloud Quest](https://cloudquest.skillbuilder.aws/). It's a game-like platform for learning AWS. I will give it a try. And if I do 12 assigments till June 30, I get 25% discounton Cloud Practitioner Certification Exam.
