I am starting my journey today. I am starting with [[ChatGPT's 30 Days of DevOps]]. I think, it's an interesting starting point.

Yesterday I analized the plan, subscribed to DevOps industry influencers recommended by ChatGPT, found all the books from the list of 10 most essential books for DevOps beginners, also recommended by ChatGPT. I put all these recommendations to [[ChatGPT's 30 Days of DevOps]].

I've also started to post this to [my website](https://ilin.tech).

So,
#### **Day 1: DevOps Introduction**
- Read "The Phoenix Project" by Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, and George Spafford
- Watch: [Introduction to DevOps and its culture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I94-tJlovg)

I've started to read "The Phoenix Project" and "The DevOps Handbook" simultaneously. The first book looks so wordy and irrelevant, but I hope I change my mind later.
