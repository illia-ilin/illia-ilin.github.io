According to the [[ChatGPT's 30 Days of DevOps]], the fourth day plan is:

#### **Day 4: Configuration Management**
- Read: [Introduction to Configuration Management](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/automation/what-is-configuration-management)
- Practice: [Set up and use Ansible for configuration management](https://www.ansible.com/resources/get-started)
**UPD:** The link for practice is for Ansible Automation Platform, which is a commercial, enterprise-grade solution built on top of the open-source Ansible project. So I recommend to start from the [Ansible community documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/). Also, I started to practice with ["Ansible for DevOps. Server and configuration management for humans"](https://leanpub.com/ansible-for-devops) by [Jeff Geerling](https://leanpub.com/u/geerlingguy).

I've started the day with the new task at [[AWS Cloud Quest]]. 
Also I decided to start using Toggl for time management.

##### What is configuration management?

> Configuration management—an important part of IT service management (ITSM)—keeps you from making small or large changes that go undocumented. Misconfigurations like these were identified in our State of Kubernetes Security report as a leading cause of security incidents among containerized or Kubernetes-orchestrated environments. 

According to the [article "Top 5 configuration management tools"](https://opensource.com/article/18/12/configuration-management-tools), there are top 5 tools:
- Ansible
- CFEngine
- Chef
- Puppet
- Salt

Also, I've discovered [[CNCF Cloud Native Landscape Project]], full of insights and helpful things for me. As example, there is [a list of Automation and Configuration management tools](https://landscape.cncf.io/card-mode?category=automation-configuration&grouping=category&sort=stars) from it.

The other thing I did today - [[Awesome Lists for DevOps]]. It's a very helpful list of resources for DevOps I found at the GitHub.

#### Practice with Ansible
The original link from ChatGPT was for practice with Ansible Automation Platform, which is a commercial, enterprise-grade solution built on top of the open-source Ansible project. So after some discoveries I recommend to start from the [Ansible community documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/). Also, I started to practice with ["Ansible for DevOps. Server and configuration management for humans"](https://leanpub.com/ansible-for-devops) by [Jeff Geerling](https://leanpub.com/u/geerlingguy).

I've made some labs and practicing with Ansible using the mentioned book and Vagrant.

#### Current progress

Task | Type | Progress
--- | --- | ---:
"The Phoenix Project" | book | 4/35 chapters, 14%
"The DevOps Handbook" | book | 5%
AWS Cloud Quest | course | 5/12 assigments, 42%
