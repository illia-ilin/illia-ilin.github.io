According to the [[ChatGPT's 30 Days of DevOps]], the third day plan is:

#### **Day 3: Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
- Read: [Introduction to IaC](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3270636/what-is-infrastructure-as-code-iac.html) (unavailable)
- Practice: [Create a simple infrastructure using Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/infrastructure-as-code)
**UPD:** I suggest for practicing to use the another similar link from HashiCorp - [Create a simple infrastructure using Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/docker-get-started/infrastructure-as-code) - it's focusing on a Docker usage, instead of an example, related to AWS.

Unfortunately, the recommended article isn't available, and it seems, this article also wasn't backup at web.archive.org.

So, I decided to search for additional resources about this topic.
The nice start is the video from IBM [What is Infrastructure as Code?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWw2wuiKd5o)

I discovered [[Free Hands-on Kubernetes Training on IBM Cloud]], and, maybe, later I will give it a try.

##### Practice
It was a nice topic to discover. It was a simple introduction to Terraform.
