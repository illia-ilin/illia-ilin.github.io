In the [[Diary of DevOps. Day 0003]] I've discovered [Kubernetes tutorials:
Hands-on labs with certification](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/kubernetes-service/kubernetes-tutorials) from IBM Cloud.

That's the YouTube video [Using IBM CloudLabs for Hands-on Kubernetes Training on IBM Cloud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h-UCGJ4-BA).

> Welcome to IBM CloudLabs, an interactive way to learn essential cloud-native concepts all entirely through your browser. Users will get access to spin up a free Kubernetes cluster for 4 hours to grow their skill with 3 free interactive Kubernetes labs on IBM Cloud. Upon completing the labs, a user will have the opportunity to take a quiz and earn a badge to show off their skills.
