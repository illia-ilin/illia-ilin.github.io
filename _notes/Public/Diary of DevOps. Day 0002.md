#### **Day 2: Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**
- Read: [Introduction to CI/CD](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/principles)
- Watch: [CI/CD concepts and best practices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSv_m3KhUO8)

#### 8 Key Continuous Delivery Principles
According to the Atlassian article ["Introduction to CI/CD"](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/principles), there are 8 principles of continuous delivery:
1. Repeatable reliable process
2. Automate everything
3. Version control
4. Build in quality
5. Do the hardest parts first
6. Everyone is responsible
7. "Done" means released
8. Continuous improvement

##### Do the hardest parts first
I especially love this part from the article:

> Painful, time-consuming or error-prone tasks compound over time. Painful tasks should be addressed as soon as possible to prevent a compounding loss of energy. \[...\] “Do the hardest parts first” is also an exercise to help identify weaknesses in the organizational process. If there is a task that is procrastinated or actively avoided it is an indicator that it could be an area of improvement and should be actively pursued.

My friend Misha told me a story about her friend, who wrote a list of things he avoided and did one task from the list a day. It reminds me about "Eat 1 frog a day" from the time management practices.
