> The CNCF Cloud Native Landscape Project is intended as a map through the previously uncharted terrain of cloud native technologies. This attempts to categorize most of the projects and product offerings in the cloud native space. There are many routes to deploying a cloud native application, with CNCF Projects representing a particularly well-traveled path. It has been built in collaboration with Redpoint Ventures and Amplify Partners.
> 
> The software for the interactive landscape has been extracted to https://github.com/cncf/landscapeapp where it is used for other landscapes as well. This repo includes all of the data and images specific to the CNCF landscapes.

Interactive version: [landscape.cncf.io](https://landscape.cncf.io/).
