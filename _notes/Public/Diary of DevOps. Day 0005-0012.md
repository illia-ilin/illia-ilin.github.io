I stucked a bit after [[Diary of DevOps. Day 0004]].

I wanted to create several VMs for practicing with Ansible.

I started from Oracle. They had an opportunity to use as a free tier Arm-based Ampere A1 processors and I had this for a long time. I decided to recreate a new one, removed old and didn't get the new one. I've wasted more than 2 hours to find the solution. It seems, Oracle stopped to support this opportunity - every time I tried to create Ampere A1 instance of any shape it just showed warnings, that this VM is not available. And I finally decided to create a AWS account with 12 months of free resources to practice with them.

Also I have to mention, that these days I tried to take part in in the program ["Grow Your Career with Google Cloud: DevOps & Architect"](https://rsvp.withgoogle.com/events/grow-your-career-with-google-cloud/about) for Ukrainians, took part in webinar, then finished the very first lab on the Google Cloud Skills Boost platform to start, but, unfortunately, because of a weak support from the team I decided not to waste my time. I sent several emails with details about the problem and got only formal letters without any support.

#### Things these days, related to DevOps:
Thanks to the Toggl, I measured some my activities these days:
1. AWS Cloud Quest - 4.5 hours
2. Working with Oracle Cloud - 2.5 h
3. Practice with Ansible - 2 hours
4. Creating the [[Awesome Lists for DevOps]] - 2 h
5. Working with my DevOps profile and CV - 1 h
6. AWS Configuration - 0.5 hours

I think, there was another time (I didn't count the time wasted on a  program for DevOpses from Google - it was several hours).

I think, I have to pay my attention to any time I spent. With Toggl and, maybe, focusing using a 15-minutes blocks.

Also these days I almost didn't read my books, because I borrowed my Kindle to my partner's daughter. And also discovered, that Amazon Kindle library of my books isn't available for Web version. I discovered very helpful service [Send to Kindle](https://www.amazon.co.uk/sendtokindle) and also found that currently Amazon is blocking from sending MOBI and AZW3 formats. So I used [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/download) to convert my existing books to EPUB. And to keep them in the library.

I continue to move with [[ChatGPT's 30 Days of DevOps]].
