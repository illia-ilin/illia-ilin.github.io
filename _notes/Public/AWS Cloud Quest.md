> AWS Cloud Quest is the only role-playing game to help you build practical AWS Cloud skills. Choose your role - Cloud Practitioner, Serverless Developer, Solutions Architect, Machine Learning Specialist, Security Specialist, or Data Analytics Specialist - then learn and apply cloud skills to help the citizens of your virtual city. Once you finish all the assignments in your role, showcase your achievement with a digital badge. Whether youâ€™re starting your cloud learning journey or diving into specialized skills, AWS Cloud Quest helps you learn in an interactive, engaging way.

I've started it two days before I started the [[Diary of DevOps]]. And for now I find it as a very interesting service to learn new things about AWS. In my opinion, it's nice to get a lot of questions about services to become familiar with them.

I plan to update this note with new information later.
